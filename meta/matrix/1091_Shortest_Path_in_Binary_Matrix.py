class Solution:
    """
    This code implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path 
    in a binary matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, 
    where 0 represents a valid path and 1 represents a blocked cell. 
    It marks visited cells in the grid and maintains a dictionary to reconstruct 
    the path to each cell.

    Starting from the top-left, it iteratively explores all valid neighboring cells 
    (up to 8 directions) level by level, updating the path and incrementing the path 
    length until it either reaches the target or exhausts all possible paths.

    If a path to the bottom-right corner exists, it returns the path length and the 
    full path taken; otherwise, it returns -1 and an empty list to indicate no path 
    was found.

    BFS over an NÃ—N grid: In the worst case, the algorithm visits each cell once, leading to 
    O(N ^ 2) queue operations.
    Copying paths for each visit: For each cell we visit, we create a new path by appending the current cell to an existing path, which can take 
    O(N ^ 2) time in the worst case (a path can grow up to 
    O(N ^ 2) length).
    O(N ^ 4)
