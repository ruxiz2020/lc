#this is the solution of Question 528 on Leetcode
#O(log(n)) time complexity for each pickIndex operation, O(n) space complexity


# we need to do a weighted random selection and probability of each element increases with its value
# we can do a prefix sum and choose a random number between 0 and last number in array.
# then we'll do a binary search to find the index of that number.
# if ith element is large, after prefix sum, arr[i] - arr[i-1] will be large and probability of selecting a random
# int between arr[i-1] and arr[i] will increase
