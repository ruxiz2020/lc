    This code finds the longest subarray containing at most 
    k zeros in a binary array nums using the sliding window technique,
    where two pointers (l and r) define the window and dynamically 
    adjust as the count of zeros exceeds 

    When a zero is encountered, 
    k is decremented, and if 
    k becomes negative, the left pointer (l) is advanced to shrink 
    the window until the number of zeros within the window is 
    â‰¤k, ensuring the constraint is maintained.
